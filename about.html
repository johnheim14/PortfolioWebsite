            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="about">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is John Heim, and I've been tinkering with computers and technology ever since I can remember. My parents both had some technical skills with computers, and my brothers and I all took an interest in them as we grew up.
                We also spent a lot of time playing video games and I had always dreamed of designing my own some day. I have spent the last 20 years learning and building skills, and would love to work professionally with technology.</br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my wife and our two dogs (Pictured Below), as well as hiking and working on our house as much as our budget allows me to. I'm currently working both as a Dietary Cook
                and a Certified Nursing Assistant at the local nursing home here in Harmony, Minnesota. Other hobbies of mine include playing and designing video games, watching movies, playing guitar and piano, and 3D modeling to name a few.
